Ted Chronopoulos, Paul Conway and Steve Klein scored first-half goals to lead the Charleston Battery to a 3-0 victory over the Minnesota Thunder in the 2003 A-League final.

Chronopoulos and Klein were two of seven former MLS players who started for Charleston. The Battery's starting lineup also included Terry Phelan, who started for Ireland in the 1994 World Cup.

The title was Charleston's second. It won the USISL's Pro League title in 1996, the last year before the merger of the Pro League and A-League. The loss marked the fourth time the Thunder lost in the A-League final. It also lost in the 1996 USISL Select League final.

The 20023 final drew a Battery franchise-record crowd of 5,711 fans at Blackbaud Stadium.
